# About me

Hello! My name is Ryan Feller, and I am a 17 year old student. I have held an interest in game design for a long time, and in 2019 I finally decided it was time to learn how to make games! Since then, I have gained experience working in Blender, Unreal Engine, Unity, and Visual Studio! I enjoy working on projects with others, and have learned a lot through making games. I have worked developers, programmers, and artists from around the world through game jam competitions. I also enjoy working with members of my schoolâ€™s programming club on projects. My hobbies include game development, cycling, hanging out with friends, and playing games!
